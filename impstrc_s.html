<h1> Writing your own strcpy_s in c </h1>

<p> As you probably know if you are coding in Microsoft Visual Studio, there is a function called strcpy_s, now the function is useful but it only works on some compilers
because of strcpy_s is a "safe" function which is optional in the C11 standard, but I have implemented a function which works like strcpy_s, so the source code is here: 
</p>

</p>
#include &ltstddef.h&gt
#include &ltstring.h&gt
int wcpy(char* Dest, size_t size, const char* source) {
	
	<br>
	int v;
	<br>
	size_t b = strlen(source) + 1;
	<br>
	if (b == size || b < size) {
				  <br>
		for (size_t a = 0; a < b; a++) {
					 
			Dest[a] = source[a];
		}
		v = 0;
			<br>	
	}
	<br>
	 if (b > size || b > strlen(Dest ) + 1) {

		 v = -1;
		}
<br>
	 return v;
}
</p>
