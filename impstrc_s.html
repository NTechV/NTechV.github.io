<h1> Writing your own strcpy_s in c </h1>

<p> If you code in Microsoft Visual Studio or use MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++), you know that there is a function called "strcpy_s"
	This function is useful, however, it isn't available for most compilers without tweaking them. I have a implemented a function called
	"wcpy" that does this portably so you don't have to use MSVC.

</p>

#include &ltstddef.h&gt
<br>
#include &ltstring.h&gt
<br>
int wcpy(char* Dest, size_t size, const char* source) {
	
	<br>
	int v;
	<br>
	size_t b = strlen(source) + 1;
	<br>
	if (b == size || b < size) {
				  <br>
		for (size_t a = 0; a < b; a++) {
					 
			Dest[a] = source[a];
		}
		v = 0;
			<br>	
	}
	<br>
	 if (b > size || b > strlen(Dest ) + 1) {

		 v = -1;
		}
<br>
	 return v;
}
